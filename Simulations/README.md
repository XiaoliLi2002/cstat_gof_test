## ðŸ“‚ Structure
- `simulations/Codes_and_Data` - All the codes and data we used in our paper.
- `simulations/Section4` â€“ Code and results for Section 4 (Simulation Studies)
- `simulations/Section5` â€“ Code and results for Section 5 (Applications to Astrophysical Data)
- `simulations/Appendix_C` - Code and results for Appendix C (Extra numerical Results)
- `simulations/utils/` â€“ Helper functions used across sections
