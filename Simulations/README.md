# Simulation Codes for "Making high-order asymptotics practical: correcting goodness-of-fit test for astronomical count data"

This repository contains the code, data, and results for reproducing the simulations in our paper

---

## ðŸ“‚ Structure
- `simulations/Codes_and_Data` - All the codes and data we used in our paper.
- `simulations/Section4` â€“ Code and results for Section 4 (Simulation Studies)
- `simulations/Section5` â€“ Code and results for Section 5 (Applications to Astrophysical Data)
- `simulations/Appendix_C` - Code and results for Appendix C (Extra numerical Results)
- `simulations/utils/` â€“ Helper functions used across sections

## ðŸš€ Quick Start
Example for reproducing Figure 1 of Section 4:

cd simulations/Section4

run the code: `Histogram.py`
