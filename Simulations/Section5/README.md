# Section 5 ‚Äì Applications to Astrophysical Data

This folder contains the code, data, and results for reproducing **Section 5** of our paper.

---

## üìÑ Overview
In Section 5, we use our methods to test whether the constant model is sufficient for each of the four spectra.
The main conclusion is that commonly used default $\chi^2$ approximation gives severe false acceptances and rejections.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Reproduce
1. Make sure you have installed the dependencies from the main README.
   
2. Run: `pg1116Spectra.py` (Figure 5, left panel), `Constant_fit_test.py` (Table 2) and `pg1116-3145-20/Constant_fitted.py` (Results for one single segment of 20 segments).

This will:
- Load the data from `countFormatxxx.dat` or `pg1116-3145-20/countFormatxxx-segment-xxx-20.dat`, where "xxx" represents digits.
- Run the script
- Then the script will directly print the figure or results.
