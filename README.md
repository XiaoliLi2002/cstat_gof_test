# High-Energy Astronomy Goodness-of-Fit (HEAGOF)


We developed **HEAGOF** for the broader astronomical community and other researchers that need goodness-of-fit assessments for heterogeneous low-count Poisson data.

**HEAGOF** enables researchers to directly obtain well-calibrated principled goodness-of-fit assessment in a straightforward manner without needing a full understanding of the technical details requiredeither to determine an appropriate approximation to the null distribution or to define and fit a fully Bayesian model.
