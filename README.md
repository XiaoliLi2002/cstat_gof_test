Here includes the codes to implement algorithms in the paper "Making high-order asymptotics practical: correcting goodness-of-fit test for astronomical count data".

The files in the directory "Simulations" are the data and codes used in our paper.

The files in the directory "cstat_HEAGOF" are codes for users to implement goodness-of-fit test with Cstat by using algorithms described in our paper.
